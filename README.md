# GPU Ray Tracing

I want to build a ray tracer using Rust. I have previously tried to do this but failed at different steps. Since this is going to be specifically for my Junior Independent Study, I expect myself to be able to accomplish a great deal.


## Dependencies

Since we are using the Bevy game engine, it is the biggest dependency. Following the instruction in https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup/ to be able to run Bevy on your computer.
